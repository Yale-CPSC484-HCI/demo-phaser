# A Phaser 3 HCI Project Demo

This code shows how to create a simple [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) application using Javascript. Many Phaser 3 tutorials can be found [here](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/).

## Running the example

Run server a simple Python 3 server to host the image files needed for the Phaser 3 project:

```python
$ python3 -m http.server [-b ADDRESS] [port]
```

For example, the command `python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1 4444` would run the server on the local host using port 4444. Once the server is running, you should be able to access it via a browser at `http://ADDRESS:port`, such as http://127.0.0.1:4444.

## Example websites

### Phaser Hello World

Once the server is running, you can test the sample Phaser 3 Hello World! website by opening the `hello_world.html` file on a browser. You should then see:
